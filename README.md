### üöÄ About the challenge

In this challenge, you will be creating a new application to learn new things and train what you have learned so far in Node.js alongside TypeScript, including using a database with TypeORM, and ManyToMany relationships!

This will be an application that should allow the creation of customers, products and orders, where the customer can generate new purchase orders for certain products, such as a small e-commerce.
